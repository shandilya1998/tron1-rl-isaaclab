"""In-place primitive-geometry updates for *instanced* articulation links.

The Isaac Sim MuJoCo importer authors each body's geometry as an instanceable
internal reference: ``<robot>/<root>/<body>/{visuals,collisions}`` are instance
prims whose box lives under ``/visuals/<body>/<geom>`` and
``/collisions/<body>/<geom>`` inside the per-individual Universal Scene
Description layer, each an ``Xform`` carrying the box's ``xformOp:scale`` and
``xformOp:translate`` and referencing a unit ``UsdGeomCube`` in ``/meshes``
(MjcfImporter.cpp:1236-1266, MjcfUsd.cpp:820-826).  Instanced geometry cannot
be overridden through an environment prim, so the box is set on the
prototype's own source ``Xform`` via the ``Sdf`` layer API.

Three conventions of that layout differ from the URDF importer's and are the
reason this module cannot be shared with it.  The scale is the MuJoCo
half-extent rather than the full edge length; the geometry ``Xform`` under the
prototype is named after the MuJoCo geom, which is ``_geom_<N>`` when the geom
is unnamed, rather than the URDF importer's positional ``mesh_<i>``; and every
body prim sits one level deeper, under the root body's own ``Xform``, while
the joints scope stays directly beneath the referenced asset prim.  The first
is handled by writing half-extents, the second by discovering the single box
child rather than naming it, and the third by taking the root body's name from
the population.  See plans/design_generator_integration.md section 4.6.

Mass, inertia and centre of mass (the body prim) and the child-joint anchor
(the joints scope) are NOT instanced; they reach each environment by the
*reference* to the design's Universal Scene Description, and they are
generally authored in a DIFFERENT layer than the geometry, the importer
emitting base, physics, robot and sensor into separate sub-stages that the
root layer then carries as variant-selected payloads
(PluginInterface.cpp:395-460).  Each quantity is therefore resolved from its
own authoring layer via the corresponding prim's property stack, never assumed
to share the geometry layer.  Editing one design's prototype and source
updates all of its instances on the next ``sim.reset()``.

Every number written here is computed by the design generator from the same
specification that emitted the document, so this module performs no geometry
inference of its own: it neither recovers a density nor assumes an axis along
which a link grows.  See ``co_optimisation/runners/usd_generator.py``'s
``_entry``.

The simulation must be stopped before calling these helpers; a single timed
``sim.reset()`` reactivates physics after all per-design edits are authored.
